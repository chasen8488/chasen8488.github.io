Hello blog, here's a weekly update on how I feel about the class and what I've been doing.

Right now I'm feeling normal about the class. It's not easy, but I can get by. I feel relatively well with my partners as they keep me on task and help me with my work. As long as I have someone I can rely on to help me when I'm struggling I should be ok in any class. I've been trying to keep up and have done a pretty good job at it.

Currently  we are learning about color in CS. Last class we had to use different colored paper to make a flag. I used the flag of Germany because of the vibrant colors. I think one of the reasons we did this was because of all the colors and designs that goes into actually making a flag. Usually the first thing a country does is make a flag.

I've had a little struggle with notes and when to take them. When the teacher writes something down I know then why would I write it down. I'm answering my own question here but I think even if I already knew what the material was there's no downside in writing down and studying the material.
