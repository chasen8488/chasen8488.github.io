    Well so far for me the course has been pretty interesting, I think GitHub is an amzing site which could really help me out with college applications and such. Right now we're just following instructions to get the site up and running and I'm almost there. I've never really done anything like this so it's nice to be learning new things in CS.
    
    So far the challenge that I've faced would be the CS graphing. It confuses me a little bit because I've gotten so used to regular algebraic graphing. 
    
    Today we learned about how to make a flipnote in CS and I really got the hang of it.
